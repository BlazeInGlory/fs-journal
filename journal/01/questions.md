# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?

    >It helps manage our codes in an orderly way and keeps things fairly organized.
     It also seems like an easy and accessible way to upload projects, especially in team/class environments.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?

    > to make a directory, or a folder, without needing to open the folders directly.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use? 

    > things to help make your page look fly ;P . Probably things like a pulsing button or maybe some cool shading tricks. (honestly not entirely sure)

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?

    > I believe it decides which style to use on an element, if there are 2 or more, and does a lot of math mumbo jumbo and sets a weight to them to decide which one will overrule the other to be used.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

    > I would assume it wouldn't run any of them, or maybe just the last one?

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > selector, property, and value, so in your example h1 would be the selector, color would be the property, and value would be the value you would set to it. 

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

    > being on the web a lot already, my answer would be a ton. I've questioned websites like Craigslist for many moons wondering how something so cheesy could be such a huge well known website, when I feel like I could write something better just by the end of this course! =) I feel like ads are a good example on things to convey excitement, like a click-now feeling (although never click them ;P)

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?

    >To simple things down a little, to show other developers or someone the basics of your page, basically putting your page in "layman's terms", and make it easier to identify or explain something.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?

    > Yes, because you could probably reuse them and they could be very helpful in school environments or on projects.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`

    > It will stretch the layout of something to fit within the border and make it equal lengths so you don't have a bunch of empty space within your border.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?

    > Width and height, so top right left bottom, and you'd adjust it's margin.
