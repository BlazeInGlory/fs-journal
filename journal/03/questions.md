# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. I'll be honest, I had to look these up, so I'll try to define them in my own words.

  -encapsulation - wraps everything into one object, and makes it easier to manipulate and leave it be.

  -inheritance - shares features with other objects, so it's easier to relate to it and use it's features and behaviors.

  -polymorphism - we can play with it as an object and do different things to it at different times, and treat groups of objects that share an ancestor as if they were that ancestor.

  Hope this worked.


02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  >Default only exports ONE thing, while regular export can do a group of things that are named.

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > As stated above, it wraps everything into an object, and makes it easier to manipulate and leave alone.

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > Makes it easier to draw objects (i'm assuming), creates an intermediary and makes things a bit simpler when linking things with lots of traits.

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > I believe a class is indefinite, while an instance of a class is a one time thing on refresh? slight guess here.

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > When you take multiple values and calculate them together to create one stored value.

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > splits up the files, and makes it easier to navigate through errors, I'm assuming you can play around a lot more with it as well, considering we're barely touching the surface and i'm doing stuff in my websites I've never even seen before xD

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > Basically the controller of a playstation. When a USER inputs a command, the controller is what the use to input said command. And then I believe the service takes over from there and will actually manipulate it. (i might be using the wrong word with service, but i believe that's it.)

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > heyyyy I just said something about this! haha. It is where usually most of your data goes to be manipulated. it takes the command from the controller, FOR the model, to do THINGS that the service has coded in.

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > Well aside from posting pictures in Vogue and being America's next top model, (kidding), the model is like the basic blueprints of an object. so like say Mario. He would be a model, or an outline, of a character in a game for example. If i were to make a car for a website, I would create it in the model area of JS.
