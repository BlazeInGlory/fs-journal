4. What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?

  > Makes things show up on the page as soon as it loads! 

5. What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?

6. What is the package.json file used for?

  > Metadata functions, for like the naming of a project and other stuff

8. What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?
