04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> allows you to change the behavior of an object by encapsulating it into different strategies.

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created

06. What is test driven development?

> writing a failing test case and then creating just enough code to pass the test.

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

08. Give two examples of a user story:

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> During the planning stages of the sprint with your team.

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?
